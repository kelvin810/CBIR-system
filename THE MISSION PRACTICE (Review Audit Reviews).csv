It felt as though they were merely going through the motions, with no genuine intention to provide assistance or support. Despite attempting to articulate my concerns, I was met with indifference and a dismissive attitude.What struck me the most was their apparent disregard for the Hippocratic Oath and the fundamental principles of medical care. As a patient seeking help and guidance, I expected to be treated with respect and dignity. However, what I encountered was a stark contrast to this expectation.Furthermore, the overall atmosphere of the facility was unwelcoming and sterile, devoid of the warmth and compassion one would hope to find in a healthcare setting. It's disheartening to witness such a blatant disregard for the holistic well-being of patients.In conclusion, I cannot in good conscience recommend this establishment to anyone seeking medical assistance. The lack of genuine care and professionalism exhibited by the doctors is deeply troubling and does a disservice to those in need of medical attention. It is my sincere hope that the necessary steps are taken to address these deficiencies and ensure that all patients are treated with the compassion and respect they deserve.","",""

Cue to 3 months later, and I'm still in pain and the bone is still wrong, I go back and am referred for an MRI; the MRI shows that my patella is actually bipartite, and the doctors doesn't know what to do so I have to be referred to a specialist.5) The referral was not processed properly, as I was given misinformation from the reception (asserting that I had been referred when I knew I hadn't been according to the discussion on the phone with the doctor); so there's been a delay of 4 weeks between the MRI and even BEING referred. For an issue I first went to them about in October 2019.4 months of pain and counting. That could have been avoided if the doctors and receptionists actually did their job properly. To say I'm angry is an understatement.","",""

Please notice I felt I had to write this review after too many disappointing experiences.Waiting time for appointments is too long, the app they force you to use for bookings is not well thought (gives only a 2 weeks span to book appointments), reception staff is often unprofessional, waiting time at the appointment is ridiculously long (every given time), and the only time it was me to be late (15 min) they cancelled my appointment (most likely my turn had not came yet).This morning they gave me an appointment at 8:30, the exact opening timing of the practice, forcing me to wait outside in the cold; and when I got in, the doctor was not there yet!Some of the doctors are nice and professional, but all they do is prescribing painkillers, doing all they can to avoid or delay exams. Sorry but this is NOT a scientific approach, medicine is not a religion, not a trial and error guess game.In a word, disgraceful.","",""

My first London Doctor surgery was so bad they almost killed me!  I have only knocked a point off for The Mission because waiting times for non-emergencies are so long.  This can make complicated health problems take months and months to sort out but it really isn't their fault.  If you have a real emergency, they will try and get you seen asap and I'm thankful for their best efforts.  I have seen a lot of reviews slating the reception staff and to a point am relieved to see or hear one I know has been particularly helpful previously but they are a very very busy practice and can't bend the rules to suit every individual.  My experiences vary so I would imagine they are frequently trying new ways of managing the system.  I have never felt judged, rushed or not listened to when I have reason to contact them.  They are a shining example of a great surgery in a tough area and with not nearly enough resources.  If you are a patient patient I'd recommend them.","",""
